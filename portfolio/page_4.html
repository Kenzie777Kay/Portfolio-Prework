        What I want for my future is to be able to afford a decent life for my family while doing something I enjoy.
        I want my kids in sports and whatever else they might want to do and not have the money as an issue.
        I want time at home with my kids to make sure they turn out as decent, hard working adults.
        providing for my family and making sure our home is one we all want to be in is my main goal.
