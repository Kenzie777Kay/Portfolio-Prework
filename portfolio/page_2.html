    <h1 class="abtme">About Me</h1>
    <img class= "imagep2" src="images/dadken.jpg" height=500px width=350px ;>
    <p class="abtme"> My name is Mckenzie Kay Malo and I was born and raised in Washington state in the small town of Hockinson
        it is mainly farm land and cows.<br> I went to a very small highschool that had only been open a few years.
        I graduated in 2013 and moved to Texas where my dad and sisters were.<br> I learned how to drive a school bus and went part time to 
        college. In 2016 I was T-boned by a semi truck and spend the next few years recovering <br> through surgery and physical therapy.
        I continued college but just felt like i wasn't getting anywhere or learning actual skills that would one day get me a job.<br>
        I moved to Washington and Idaho during my recovery to end up finally back in Texas to stay.
        Now that im where i want to be it seemed the perfect time to get <br> into the coding bootcamp. I sapient a lot of my childhood watching 
        my grandfather code after he leared it from a few text books. Seeing how coding affected his life <br> in such a positive way gave me a drive 
        to learn coding. after a few test sites and free courses I decided I wanted to submerge myself into coding full time and 
        start learning <br> for my future. to learn more about my family or future please click the links at the top of the page.
